Prioritize garment and fashion resale details. Read every tag and measurement photo.
For clothing: capture exact brand, printed size, size type, department, fabric/material percentages, care/country tag, style, type, pattern, neckline, sleeve length, fit, closure, rise, inseam, waist, dress/skirt length, lining, hood, and condition flaws.
For shoes: capture US/UK/EU size, width, upper/sole material, style, toe shape, heel height, closure, model, and condition of soles/insoles.
For bags/accessories: capture style/type, exterior/interior material, closure, strap type/drop, hardware color, lining, pockets, dimensions, and flaws.
Do not fill hard-good fields unless they are actually relevant.`,
  hard_goods: `\n\nPROFILE: HARD GOODS
Prioritize durable-goods catalog details. Look for labels, plates, bottoms, stickers, packaging, manuals, molded marks, and printed specs.
Capture exact item type, brand/maker, model, MPN/part number, serial number, UPC/barcode, color, material, dimensions, capacity, power source, voltage, compatibility, included accessories, country/region of manufacture, year/date codes, style, finish, features, and condition/testing status.
For untested electronics or appliances, say untested in condition_notes instead of implying functionality.
For parts/accessories, capture Compatible Brand and Compatible Model when visible or obvious from packaging.`,
  art: `\n\nPROFILE: ART
Prioritize art-specific cataloging. Capture artist/maker, title/subject, medium, style, production technique, original vs reproduction, signed status, signature location, date/year, image size, frame size, framing/matting, surface/material, edition number, provenance labels, gallery or publisher marks, and condition.
Use category_hint to target the exact medium, such as 'signed watercolor painting', 'framed lithograph', 'bronze sculpture', or 'vintage art print'.
Do not invent an artist name. Use Unknown if no signature or label is visible.`,
  media: `\n\nPROFILE: MEDIA
Prioritize media identifiers and edition details. Capture title, author/artist/band/game name, publisher/label/studio, format, ISBN/UPC/EAN, release year, edition, language, genre, platform, region code, rating, disc count, record speed/size, case type, included manuals/inserts, and condition.
For books, include binding, dust jacket, printing/edition if visible, ISBN, author, publisher, and publication year.
For video games/software, include platform, region, rating, publisher, manual/case status, and any visible product codes.
For records/CDs/DVDs, include format, artist, title, label/studio, catalog number, barcode, and media/sleeve condition.`,

Capture maker/brand, character, franchise/series, subject, theme, material, production style/technique, year/era, country, signed status, original vs reproduction, scale, edition/limited number, set contents, markings, stamps, backstamps, tags, packaging, and condition flaws.
For ceramics/glass/figurines, check bottoms for maker marks, pattern names, production style, finish, and damage.
For cards/coins/stamps/ephemera, capture year, set/series, card number/denomination, grade/slab details if present, and visible condition issues.

• For jewelry → identify exact jewelry type (ring, necklace, bracelet, earrings, brooch, pendant, charm, cufflinks, watch accessory, etc.), clasp/closure, main stone, metal/base metal, metal purity or hallmarks (925, 10K, 14K, etc.), signed/maker marks, approximate length, ring size, vintage/antique status, and whether it appears handmade

For title: Make it read like a strong live eBay title, using the most searchable nouns, brand, model, type, material, size, era, character, theme, or pattern when supported by the photos.
For condition: Do NOT use LIKE_NEW. If an item is near mint but preowned, use EXCELLENT instead.
For suggested_price: Price realistically for what this exact item sells for on eBay. Be honest. If the item can't be identified well enough to price it, use 0 — the seller will price it manually (a wrong guess is worse than no guess).
For item_specifics: Only include fields relevant to this item. Leave any field blank ("") if not applicable or unknown — do NOT guess. Omit all section-label keys (the ones that look like "--- TOPS ---") from your response.
For category/category_hint: The broad category can be approximate, but the category_hint should help eBay find the exact leaf category for whatever type of item this is.
For all item types: include as many accurate specifics as the photos support, even for non-clothing items such as collectibles, media, home decor, toys, tools, sporting goods, art, kitchenware, and electronics accessories.`;
