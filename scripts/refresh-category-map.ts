/**
 * Regenerate the static CATEGORY_MAP in lib/ebay/publish.ts for the eBay
 * marketplace you are configured for — using eBay's Taxonomy API as the
 * source of truth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * eBay category IDs are per-marketplace: the US category tree is id 0, the UK
 * tree is id 3, Germany is 77, etc. Some IDs coincide across sites but many do
 * not, so a leaf id that is correct on eBay.com can be a wrong (or non-leaf)
 * category on eBay.co.uk. The live publish path already resolves the right
 * leaf for the active tree via suggestLeafCategories() — and when eBay rejects
 * a category it retries with eBay's own runner-up suggestions for that item,
 * so there is no static fallback-category list to maintain. CATEGORY_MAP is
 * only the OFFLINE FALLBACK used when the Taxonomy call is unavailable at
 * publish time. This script regenerates it so it matches whichever marketplace
 * you list on (and survives eBay's periodic category-tree reshuffles).
 *
 * It does NOT edit publish.ts — it prints a ready-to-paste block so you can
 * review the resolved IDs before committing them. Diff the output against the
 * current map; eBay's top suggestion is always a valid leaf but not always the
 * best category, so keep any hand-picked value you prefer.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   EBAY_CLIENT_ID=...      \
 *   EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=...   \
 *   npx tsx scripts/refresh-category-map.ts
 *
 * Marketplace defaults to EBAY_US / tree 0. For another marketplace set the
 * env overrides from lib/ebay/config.ts, e.g.:
 *   EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID=EBAY_GB EBAY_CATEGORY_TREE_ID=3 npx tsx scripts/refresh-category-map.ts
 *
 * Then paste the printed CATEGORY_MAP into lib/ebay/publish.ts.
